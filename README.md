//Rubik's Cube Solver
//Project Overview
• Developed a Rubik's Cube solver in C++, employing standard Data Structures, BFS, DFS and IDDFS algorithms.
• Created an optimized cube representation and move notation system to enhance solving time and performance.
• Employed the IDA* algorithm for a rapid exploration of the solution space, finding optimal solutions efficiently.
• Thoroughly tested and benchmarked the solver against different existing algorithms to ensure a better efficiency.
